YORB2020 is a shared virtual space to hang out, collaborate and work near each other.  

## About

**YORB2020** is based on the 1990s interactive television show *YORB* (Your Orb) created by Dan O'Sullivan for Manhattan Neighborhood Network -- a public access television station in New York City.  It existed and evolved over several years as an ongoing project at the [Interactive Telecommunications Program](https://tisch.nyu.edu/itp) (ITP) at New York University.  

For more information about *YORB*, see the *YARCHIVE* at [yorb.online](yorb.online).

**YORB2020** is a project built by a number of the current [Researchers in Residence](https://itp.nyu.edu/residents/) at ITP.  Inspired by YORB and created in response to the quarantine conditions of COVID-19, this project attempts to provide the ITP community with a shared virtual space to hang out, collaborate and work near each other.  


## Technology:

This space is built using a number of technologies, including:

* [three.js](https://threejs.org/) provides rendering / 3D environment interactivity
* [socket.io](https://socket.io/) provides the three.js multiplayer functionality, and acts as a WebRTC signaling server
* [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API) provides video / audio chat functionality
* [Rhino3D](https://www.rhino3d.com/) for building the floor model
* [Blender](blender.org) conversion of model into GLTF files


And uses code from a number of sources, including: 

* Or Fleisher - [THREE.Multiplayer](https://github.com/juniorxsound/THREE.Multiplayer) server and client setup socket.io
* Miko≈Çaj Wargowski - [Simple Chat App](https://github.com/Miczeq22/simple-chat-app) using [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)
* Zachary Stenger - [Three.js Video Chat](https://github.com/zacharystenger/three-js-video-chat) using [WebRTC](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API)
